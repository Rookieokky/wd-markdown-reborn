# wd-markdown-reborn
Electron tutorial salvaged from a WebDesigner magazine article. This app is a multi-tabbed markdown editor that uses marked and Ace editor. Use this app to see what you can do with Electron and as a starting point to expand the editor features.

Bootstrap and jQuery are installed via bower until I can figure how to bring it all under npm.

## Using

You can build it yourself (see below).
